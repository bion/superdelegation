          Reaching out to voters directly is what turns a 30 point deficit in
          the polls into a political upset. We've seen this time and time again
          over the course of the 2016 primaries. Canvassing in your
          neighborhood, phonebanking, texting, and Facebanking are effective and
          easy tools at your disposal to instantly multiply your contribution
          to the campaign. Why stop at your own vote when you can convince 10,
          100, or 1,000 more people to Feel the Bern? There is work to be done
          for even the most phone-shy:
